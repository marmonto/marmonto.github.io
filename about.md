👋 Hello World! <br />
✌️  I’m Marlon { @marmonto }.


👨‍🚀 Something (in tec) About me:

<p>
⌛ In my beginnings at Tec, C# .Net, Java, JavaScript, T-SQL, and UML made me a Developer. <br />
I spent time on requirements, architectures, testing, and deep communication between clients and teams to code.  <br />
I moved to IT, beeing in charge of Windows and Linux Servers, security and networking. <br />
I learned a lot, specially in HA-DR with clustering, backup strategies, storage management and virtualization with Hyper-V and VMWare. <br />
I soon started as Database Administrator by accident, taking advange of my knowledge from my Dev days. <br />
I was able to learn, design, apply, coordinate, monitor, scale, update-upgrade, refactor, and improve database infrastructures for different companies. <br />
Combine my knowledge in Dev, Sec, and Ops to build and scale infrastructures. <br />
</p>


<p>
🤯 Each company, project, and team challenged me.  <br />
I have been able to learn and differentiate myself by having the support of collegues and leaders, projecting myself to become a better engineer, a team player and a team leader. <br />
